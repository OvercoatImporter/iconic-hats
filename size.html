				<h1>Sizing Guide</h1>
				<h2>Choose the Right Hat Size</h2>
				<h3 style="text-align: left">
					Follow these steps to select an appropriate hat size for
					your head:
				</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
					<li>
						Grab a flexible tape measure. The tape measure can be
						made of a bendable plastic, fabric, or cloth. You can
						also used a piece of string and a ruler.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wrap the measuring tape or string around your head,
						positioning it mid-forehead, above your eyebrows and
						ears, and around the largest part of the back of your
						head. Make sure that your measuring tape is not below
						your eyebrows.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make sure the measuring tape is level and snug, but not
						too tight, then take the measurement in centimeters or
						inches.
					</li>
					<li>
						Compare your head measurement to the hat size chart
						below.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you are between two sizes, it is recommended to
						choose the larger size, as hats can be adjusted with
						inserts or cushions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<h3 style="text-align: left">
					Tips for Choosing the Perfect Size
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Measure your head multiple times to make sure that you
						are getting an accurate measurement.
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid pulling your tape measure too tightly; it’s best
						to have more room than you need in your hat than to not
						have enough room for your head.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep in mind that head shapes and sizes differ among hat
						lovers. However, the hat size that men most commonly
						wear is 7 ⅜. Meanwhile, the average size for women is 7
						¼.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make sure that there’s some space between your head and
						the hat (about the width of your finger). Your goal
						should be to have a snug fit, not a tight one.
					</li>

The hat should sit comfortably at the center of your forehead, above your eyebrows — that is, unless you plan on wearing your hat high atop your head, backwards, or at a tilt.
The hat should never sink down too far and cover your eyebrows or obstruct your vision.
The sweatband inside the hat should fit securely without feeling restrictive or leaving lasting crease marks on your forehead.
If the sweatband stitching leaves a slight mark on your forehead that quickly fades, this is fine as long as there is no feeling of tension — pain should never be part of wearing a hat.
A good way to test a hat’s fit is to simply use your finger — if you can fit one finger between your head and the cap then you know you have the right size.
